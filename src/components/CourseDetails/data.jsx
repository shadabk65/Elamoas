        After creating more than a dozen courses on Microsoft Access databases and programming in VBA,
        many students have contacted me with discussions on specific problems and scenarios.
        From these discussions, I have created videos reviewing the details of the most useful techniques 
        that everyone will eventually need.  I have made sure that every detail of these techniques is 
        recorded in the videos!  BUT you should be somewhat familiar with VBA since there are lots of coding 
        examples in the course.
        There are MANY tips and tricks in this workshop that you will not find an ANY of my other courses!
        I also include a specific database design challenge from a student and then go over the details of how 
        I would handle it.
        If you are willing to take the time to go through this course you could easily be much more productive 
        with Microsoft Access in just a few hours!
